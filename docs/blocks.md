# Understanding the Code Editor
:::warning
These docs are not completely finished yet. We're slowly working on expanding the documentation while we work on other things, so please be patient with us!
:::

The code editor has lots of individual parts that can be named, seen below:

## The Toolbox
The Toolbox is the menu on the left that allows you to place individual blocks onto the Workspace in the center.

Click and drag a block from the Toolbox, then release the mouse on the Workspace to place a block there.

### Categories
Categories are individual sections of the toolbox that contain groups of blocks.

Each category has blocks related to the name of the category:
- **Motion:** Blocks related to moving & rotating the Sprite
- **Looks:** Blocks related to the visual look & style of the Sprite or parts of it
- **Sound:** Blocks related to playing or modifying sounds
- **Events:** Blocks that run when certain things happen in the project, or run other events
- **Control:** Logical blocks that allow you to control how a block stack runs or ends
- **Sensing:** Blocks related to sensing things on the screen, things about sprites, or sensing devices on the computer
- **Operators:** Blocks related to mathematical operations, modifying text, mechanical operations, etc

We'll return to Variables, Lists, and My Blocks later.

### Extensions
Extensions are various new categories you can import in your project if your project needs them.

Most simple projects will not require the use of any extensions, but extensions allow for additional functionality in your projects.

You can access this menu by clicking the button with the blocks and a plus at the bottom of the toolbox.

Clicking the category filters on the left will allow you to filter out extensions that you aren't looking for.
