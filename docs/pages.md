This is where you can turn your PenguinMod projects into executable programs for Windows, MacOS and Linux, ZIP archives, or web pages that you can host online.

## Modules
These are individual parts of PenguinMod that make up a section of one of PenguinMod's sites.

### The Stage
<img src="/img/docimages/stage.png" alt="Website Screenshot" height="320"></img>
*Found on [https://studio.penguinmod.com/](https://studio.penguinmod.com/).*

This is where sprites will appear in your project. Moving, rotating, resizing, or editing a sprite in any visual way will be seen on the stage.

The stage itself can also have backdrop costumes, serving as backgrounds to the project.

### Code Editor
<img src="/img/docimages/code-editor.png" alt="Website Screenshot" height="320"></img>
*Found on [https://studio.penguinmod.com/](https://studio.penguinmod.com/).*

This is where you'll place blocks that do things in the project.

Connecting blocks on the top or bottom of another block will create Block Stacks, and spots to place blocks inside of other blocks can be known as Inputs, or Arguments.

Find more info about the code editor [here.](/blocks)

### Paint Editor

Commonly referred to as the Costume editor, this section of the PenguinMod Studio allows you to draw and edit costumes in your PenguinMod projects.

You can use Vector mode to draw costumes that look clean at any zoom level, or Bitmap mode to draw with pixels.

### Sound Editor
