## What is ElectraMod?

ElectraMod is a mod of [PenguinMod](https://penguinmod.com/) which is a mod of [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/) by [GarboMuffin](https://github.com/GarboMuffin).  
We edited their code a lot to add tons of new extensions and features for people to use.

Feel free to [use ElectraMod here](https://electramod-home.vercel.app), *you don't need an account to [create a project](https://electramod.vercel.app/editor.html).*

We've been constantly working to make the site awesome for users and developers.

### Looking to make an extension?

[View the documentation](/development/extensions/introduction) for information on creating extensions.  
We've added a few small things to extensions that should hopefully allow for some interesting stuff to be made.
