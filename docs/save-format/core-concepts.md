this file format aims to
1. make it use a scratch2-like format
2. devide up all of the seperate data structures into indevidual files to accomplish goal #3 and to lower the amount of data that must be parsed for a single component of the file
3. be easy to read and understand as the user of the app
4. save the least amount of data without modifying the vm to hold the same data
