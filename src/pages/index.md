# What is PenguinMod?

PenguinMod is a mod of [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/) by [GarboMuffin](https://github.com/GarboMuffin).
We edited their code a lot to add tons of new extensions and features for people to use.

Feel free to [use PenguinMod here](https://penguinmod.com/), *you don't need an account to [create a project](https://studio.penguinmod.com/editor.html).*

## Looking to make an extension?

[View the documentation](/development/extensions/introduction) for information on creating extensions.
We've added a few small things to extensions that should hopefully allow for some interesting stuff to be made.
